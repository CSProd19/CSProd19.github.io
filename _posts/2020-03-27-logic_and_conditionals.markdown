   Getting started in Procedural Ruby allows you to go over a few basics before jumping into the deep. Logic and Conditionals were not the easiest to learn but they definitely were not the hardest. When i started learning how to code or to even read it, I felt so lost in it all. I started to reach out and write as much as I could down in my notebook. Eventually, some of it was clicking and this lab was defiitely one that helped me understand.

   In logic and conditionals, you get to go over Ternary Operators (`?:`) and `case` Statements. As well as `Else`/`If` Statements. These statements are usually very useful. There's really not much to these other then using them when you use `puts` to return something to the user. I have used them in some of my code when writing out my first CLI project so I know they come in handy quite a bit. The Ternary Operator works with boolean so depending on what you're calling in the Ternary Operator then it will return whats on the right of your `:`. Once you get a hang of how they work you will find out the same. 

   If you're wanting to understand them a little better then definitely do some extra research online to bring you more examples of how they are used. I am definitely a horrible teacher but i can help with walking through code to help understand as much as i possibly can. Thank you for your time and reading what i had to say!
