Ruby is just one of the many different ways to talk to your computer. There are too many languages to name but Ruby is one of the most user friendly languages I have learned. In Ruby there are Data Types, which is just another tool we use to determine what we're wanting our computer to do.

The Data Types are known as Booleans, Hashes, Strings, Arrays, Numbers, and Symbols. Don't worry they aren't as scary as they sound. :) These Data Types all have a job to do, which is to give things a value. Every object has to have some sort of value to it, if it is going to have a job. Now these "types" dictate to our machine what that job is exactly. Depending on you, the user, is wanting it to accomplish.

There is so much more to these Data Types and i am still learning as much as i can. I've used these types in quite a few situations where I'm getting to learn how they work together and what their similarities are exactly. In Ruby I have figured out that when using any of these Data Types, it hasn't always been the easiest but it's the learning process that counts!
