   I'm not too sure where I was in my life when i decided to make a serious change but I'm glad I did. As a young mother I had to make many sacrifices growing up. I wasn't able to do all the things my friends were doing, like going to school functions, festivals, and so much more. I also missed out on a lot of things that could've hurt me in the long run. Before i became a mother i was involved with the wrong crowd and im very thankful that i was able to escape before it was too late. In the early stages of being a parent, I quickly learned that i had no choice but to grow up and start providing like an adult. 
   I started working by the age of 16 in the food industry. Of course, doesn't everybody?! Well about 2 years later i was offered a Technical Support Rep position with a company called Harte Hanks. It was a big call center that provided services for FedEx customers who purchased software and hardware. They opened up a small department to start writing programs but it was very entry level and only a few were selected to start training. I was one of the few so I was very excited to get started. About 2 months into the training the department was closed due to being too small of a group and it was cut was from the budget. I was very upset about it but there wasn't anything any of us could do so we moved on.
	 As time went on I had no choice but to take advantage of the opportunities that presented themselves. I ended up in the automotive industry, where i learned to love engines. I started to get curious about how they work and how to build them. I wasn't so lucky to be able to formally learn the actual hand-on mechanics but i started to teach myself. I put my mind to learning on my own but i also had to continue working full time to provide for my now 2 daughters. So needless to say there isn't enough time in the day to do it all. I began to fall into the routine of working to just pay the bills.
	 Within these last 5 to 6 years, I've been needing a better change in my life. I have watched my 2 big brothers while they continue to grow thier small businesses. And i continue just to work 9 to 5 like everyone else and live paycheck to paycheck. It's time that i finally make a different choice to pursue something that i enjoy. Something that challenges me but also gives me clarity and confidence. Getting back into developing is something i've dreamed about for a long time. Here's to make a different choice!
