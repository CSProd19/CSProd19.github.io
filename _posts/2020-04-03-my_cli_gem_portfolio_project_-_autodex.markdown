Okay, so this is my first project doing any kind of code on my own completely. I also learned that as long as I utilize all my resources, I'm not completely on my own. Once, I accepted that, I was able to learn so much more and really understand what I was creating. I have always had a love for cars and the engineering behind those beautiful machines. So, I decided to create an `Autodex` if you will. It's short for Automotive Rolodex. Where you're able to find local (to my area, Corpus Christi, Tx) automotive shops that can repair or maintenance your car!

The way you install the gem is to input `gem 'autodex'` in your terminal then `bundle install` or install it yourself by running `gem install autodex`. In order to start the program, you need to run `bin/autodex` in your terminal after you've installed the gem. Once you started the program a message will display welcoming you to Autodex with a list of local auto shops. It will also prompt you to enter a number to learn about a specific auto shop. Depending on the number you enter, it will return some useful information about that shop so that you may contact them if you so choose. At that point, it will prompt you for a new number to enter if you'd like to look into another auto shop. Once you've looked over a couple different auto shops, it will then ask if you'd like to look at another auto shop with a 'yes' or a 'no'. If you decide to look into a third auto shop then it will repopulate the list of shops. If not, it will thank you and wish you a wondeful day! At any point throughout the program, you may enter `end` to exit. 

It was a very rough start as well as a late one but I was able to learn so much from so many different people and resources. It was a fun ride and I am so ready to continue on this journey of coding and enjoy every moment of it! Thank you for reading!!
